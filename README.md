# Video-Games-Sales-Analysis

Here's an explanation of the code:

Importing Libraries:

The pandas library is imported as pd for data manipulation and analysis.
The seaborn library is imported as sns for data visualization.
The matplotlib.pyplot library is imported as plt for creating plots.
Loading the Data:

The pd.read_csv() function is used to read the data from a CSV file named 'dataset.csv' and store it in a DataFrame called df.
Analysis and Visualization:

The code includes 10 questions/statements about the data, and each question is followed by code to answer or visualize the information.

Questions 1 to 5 involve basic data analysis and are answered using pandas operations on the DataFrame df.

Questions 6, 7, and 8 calculate specific sales values and print them.

Questions 9 and 10 involve data visualization using seaborn and matplotlib.

Bar plots and scatter plots are created using the sns.barplot() and sns.scatterplot() functions, respectively.

The plt.show() function is used to display the plots.

Each plot is customized with appropriate titles, labels, and rotations for better readability.

The results of the calculations and visualizations are printed using the print() function.
